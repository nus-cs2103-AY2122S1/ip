# Welcome to Duck, your very own task manager!

**Things you can do with Duck ~~Duke~~:**
1. Add different kinds of tasks
   * _Duck can keep track of tasks with specific deadlines._
   * _Having an event? Duck will keep track of your event periods as well._
   * _Just need a simple to-do list? Duck will do that too._
2. Show that tasks are done
   * _Once a task is done, mark it as so! Duck will keep track of the tasks you have completed._
3. Delete tasks
   * _Done with a task? Get rid of it. Typo? Just delete it and do it again._
4. Find a specific task
   * _Need to know what to get done today? Find tasks by date!_
   * _You can also find tasks by keywords!_

**Why you need Duck:**
- Why worry about forgetting tasks and deadlines?
- Why worry about whether you've finished something?
- I needed to make a bullet list.

All you need to do is: 

- [ ] Head over to this application's [GitHub page](https://github.com/ntwbruce/ip)!
- [ ] Download the JAR file of "Duck v0.3" under Releases
- [ ] Run the JAR file, and you're good to go! :thumbsup:

If you're curious to play around and customise this app for yourself, 
feel free to download the source code from the same [GitHub page](https://github.com/ntwbruce/ip)!

You will find the main function in `src/main/java/duck/Launcher`, as shown below. Run this to start the program!
````java
public class Launcher {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Application.launch(Main.class, args);
   }
}
````
