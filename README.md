If you are someone constantly seeking for tasks to be done, it might be difficult to remember all of them.

**Duke CAN help!**

Duke is:
* text based
* simple and easy
* ~~helpful~~ really helpful 

## Getting Started
1. Download it [here](https://github.com/wanyu-l/ip/releases/download/v0.1/Duke.java.jar)
2. Run it
3. Add your tasks
   - Don't worry, Duke will assist you with inputs!
   ```
   Hello from
    ____        _        
   |  _ \ _   _| | _____ 
   | | | | | | | |/ / _ \
   | |_| | |_| |   <  __/
   |____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|
   ```
4. Let it remember the tasks for you 😄

What it can do:
- [x] store a **List** of tasks to be done
- [x] add, **Delete** and mark tasks as **Done**
- [x] **Find** tasks by **Due** dates or keywords

Here's a part of the program, maybe it can be of help in practising coding in Java:
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Duke().run();
    }
```
