If you are someone constantly seeking for tasks to be done, it might be difficult to remember all of them.

**Duke CAN help!**

Duke is:
* text based
* simple and easy
* ~~helpful~~ *REALLY* helpful 

## Getting Started
1. Download it [here](https://github.com/wanyu-l/ip/releases/download/v0.2/Memo-Assistant.Duke.jar)
2. Run it
3. Add your tasks
   - Don't worry, Duke will assist you with inputs!
   ```
   Hello from
    ____        _        
   |  _ \ _   _| | _____ 
   | | | | | | | |/ / _ \
   | |_| | |_| |   <  __/
   |____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|
   ```   
   
### Let it remember the tasks for you 😄

## What it can do:

- [x] store a **List** of tasks to be done
- [x] add, **Delete** and mark tasks as **Done**
- [x] **Find** tasks by **Due** dates or keywords
- [x] **Reschedule** tasks to new dates (coming soon)

**Here's a part of the program, maybe it can be of help in practising coding in Java, the `main` method:**
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    new Duke().run();
}
```
