# Code Quality

Hopefully, my code is in accordance to the quality acceptable by our tutors and professors. An sample would be as follows:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    new Duke("data/duke.txt").run();
}
```

## Errors

One thing you might notice about my code is that I chose to create my errors as DukeErrors as seen below:

```java
    public class DukeException extends Exception
```

I used to use DukeErrors as an enumeration but I decided that making it extend the Exception class would make the flow of logic cleaner.
