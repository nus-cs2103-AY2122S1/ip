# DuC (That time I create a chatbot with my name for CS2103T IP because Singaporeans keep mispronouncing it in front of me  :joy::joy::thinking::vomiting_face:)

Yea you heard me right. The most generic yet difficult-to-pronounce chatbot you will have ever used. Why use me then?
Because I am **generic**, it means that there is absolutely no risk of using me. I can be the most _useful~~~_ chat bot you will ever use without even notice. Because I'm doing my job properly and not trying to market you with distrustful stuffs.

Most importantly, please learn how to pronounce my name after using DuC. Concluded with thanks.

So, enough ~~hidden marketing~~ long-winding introduction that sound like a rip-off light novel title already. What can I offer to you?

1. Schedule a to-do task
2. Schedule a deadline task with prescribed date
3. Schedule an event task with occurred date
4. Track task or delete task on completion - of your choice
5. Find task by date or by keywords

Does that sound too generic? I also offer this:
* Easy to use and remember command line
* Difficult to pronounce names that will make you question how to pronounce it 100% of the time
* Some other things because CS2103T requires so

How does DuC sound like to you? Here is a sample list of daily schedule you can follow with DuC
- [x] [T] code
- [ ] [D] code while sleeping (by everyday)
- [ ] [T] code while eating
- [ ] [T] code while taking a sh*t
- [ ] [E] code while crying in the corner of your dorm room because ~~you have no social life and are a miserable victim of crony capitalism and materialism~~ you cannot contain excessive joy in doing programming

How about a glimpse of my development process?
``` java
case "todo":
      return new TaskCommand(description, taskList, Task.Type.TODO);
case "deadline":
      return new TaskCommand(description, taskList, Task.Type.DEADLINE);
case "event":
      return new TaskCommand(description, taskList, Task.Type.EVENT);
```

Basically, there are three types of task you can add to your list:
`<todo>`,`<deadline>`,`<event>`. Sounds very generic is it? I know

Here is a random filler quote because I don't know what else to add:
> Death is like the wind. Always by my side - Yasuo
