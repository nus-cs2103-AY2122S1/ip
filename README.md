## Features

### Managing Tasks
Duke supports three main types of tasks:
1. ToDo
2. Deadline
3. Event

#### Deadline
A Deadline is defined as a task that has a specific date of completion. These tasks have to be completed by the specified date. 

#### Event
An Event is a task that occurs at a particular date. Events are tasks where the user has to attend. 

#### ToDo
A ToDo is defined as a task that does not have a specific date of completion. They are meant as a quick way to record tasks that do not have a hard date of completion, or if the date of completion is pending. 

### Sorting Tasks

#### Date
Duke supports sorting of tasks by the earliest date. Since ToDo tasks do not have a date associated with them, they are automatically appended to the back of the list upon sorting.

Note: only dates in the format ```YYYY-MM-DD``` are accepted.
