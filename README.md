## What is Augury?
Augury is a task-management application built for CS2103T - Software Engineering, as part of the Individual Project (IP).

Much like a certain (very dead) [Prince of Denmark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHUZ1_cxdyw), indecision is a common source of downfall for us humans.
Turn your future tasks into omens of good fortune, today!

>Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand.

## Features
1. **Responsive UI built with JavaFX**
   
Augury supports screens of various sizes! Switch between your favourite themes within the app!

This was my first time working on JavaFX, and I sought to create the best UI I could.
Overall, it was a great learning experience.

2. **Persistent data storage** 
   
You no longer have to be afraid of losing your data, or worry about transferring data to another device!
Augury autosaves your tasks in plaintext files (in the `data/tasks.txt` directory), so you can easily export to other formats.

3. **Command Line Interface for CLI lovers**
   
![CLI](docs/Ui-cli.png)

Are you a power user who loves the terminal?
Simply run Augury with the flag `-mode console` to launch the CLI mode!

4. **Cross-platform**

![Cross platform](docs/Ui-platforms.png)
   
Augury runs smoothly on Windows, Linux and MacOS systems!

5. **Automated Unit Testing and Github Continuous Integration**
   
Unit tests were written using JUnit in order to test the individual parts of the code.
Gradle is used in conjunction with Github Continuous Integration (CI) to ensure tests run properly every commit.

6. **Fast and intuitive task management** 

Augury provides a super-intuitive way to manage your tasks -- just create a task, include the relevant details, and mark as done once completed!

Additional features included:
- **Search** - Blazing fast search to find tasks
- **Batch operations** - Delete or Mark multiple tasks at once!
- **Manage date & time** - Create Deadline or Event tasks that have a time associated with them!
- **Command aliases** - Less keystrokes to type, more time for productivity!
