# Gnosis Project
This is a project template for a greenfield CS2103 Individual Project.
The name Gnosis means knowledge in Greek. 
Why I named it Gnosis ? 
Simply, because my aim in CS2103 (and of course in my other mods) 
<br/>is to expand my knowledge and learning.
```
Welcome, I am Gnosis.
The spark to meet your needs.
How can I assist you ?
