# Duke *ver. T*
> "Wow, this software is great!" - Me, in some other context.

This is Tim's *incredible* version of the infamous Duke software. 

It has:
* a **lot** of work and green tea :tea: put into it
* potential
* features I guess

What I did to get into this mess:
1. Sign up for CS2103T
2. Not realise what I was getting into
3. Profit..?

Here's a tiny preview of some code you'll find in this project!
``` java
public
```
Pretty cool, if I do say so myself. (You might also spot `return` somewhere in the code too)

### To-do:
- [x] start this project
- [ ] finish this project
