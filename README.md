## [](https://github.com/wowsiddanth/ip/blob/master/README.md#Uninstallation)Uninstallation

Uninstalling the Petal bot is very simple as well. 

There are two main steps:

1. Firstly, delete the .jar file itself from your system.
2. Secondly, you need to delete the **PetalData** file that contains all the save data.
It is stored at the __home directory__ of your OS.
The location of this file is OS-dependant.
	- For Windows, the file is usually stored in __C:\Users\User__.
	- For Mac users, the file is usually stored at __MacintoshHD/Users/__.
	- For Linux users, check the home directory.
