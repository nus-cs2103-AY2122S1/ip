## Features
### Tasks
Three different types of tasks to help you track your tasks better!
* Todos: Tasks without any date/time
* Deadlines: Tasks that has a specific deadline
* Events: Tasks that start and end at specific times

### Friendlier Syntax
To optimise command-line usage, the app's syntax has become shorter.

Example:
* list &#8594; ls
* done &#8594; d
* delete &#8594; del

If you plan to use Intellij IDEA (highly recommended):

1. **Configure the JDK**: Follow the guide 
   [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html)
    to ensure Intellij is configured to use JDK 11.
   
2. **Import the project as a Gradle project**: Follow the guide 
   [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html)
