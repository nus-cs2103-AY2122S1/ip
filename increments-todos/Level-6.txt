Level 6. Delete
Add support for deleting tasks from the list.


Example:

list
    ____________________________________________________________
     Here are the tasks in your list:
     1.[T][X] read book
     2.[D][X] return book (by: June 6th)
     3.[E][ ] project meeting (at: Aug 6th 2-4pm)
     4.[T][X] join sports club
     5.[T][ ] borrow book
    ____________________________________________________________

delete 3
    ____________________________________________________________
     Noted. I've removed this task:
       [E][ ] project meeting (at: Aug 6th 2-4pm)
     Now you have 4 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
 When implementing this feature, you are also recommended to implement the following extension:

Extension: A-Collections

A-Collections
â†³ Use Java Collections classes

Use Java Collections classes for storing data. For example, you can use an ArrayList<model.Task> to store the tasks.

Tasks to achieve level-6:

1. gnosis.Gnosis Class: - Done
    - Add "delete" command:
    - new deleteTask method
        - retrieve task to display before removing from list
    - add exception for task index out of bounds for delete command
