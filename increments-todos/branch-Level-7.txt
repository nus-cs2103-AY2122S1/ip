Level 7. Save
Save the tasks in the hard disk automatically whenever the gnosis.task list changes. Load the data from the hard disk when Duke starts up. You may hard-code the file name and location e.g., [project_root]/data/duke.txt

The format of the file is up to you. Example:

T | 1 | read book
D | 0 | return book | June 6th
E | 0 | project meeting | Aug 6th 2-4pm
T | 1 | join sports club
 If you use file paths in your code,

remember to use relative paths rather than absolute paths such as C:\data. If not, your app can cause unpredictable results when used in another computer.
remember to specify file paths in an OS-independent way. If not, your app might not work when used on a different OS.
 Your code must handle the case where the data file doesn't exist at the start. Reason: when someone else takes your Duke and runs it for the first time, the required file might not exist in their computer.
 Similarly, if you expect the data file to be in as specific folder (e.g., ./data/), you must also handle the folder-does-not-exist-yet case.

 Tasks to achieve level-7: (commit to branch-Level-7)



File format to save -> .csv

save in file under: [project_root]/gnosisData/gnosis.txt folder

1. Create a gnosis.task.TaskStorageManager to read/write CSV files - DONE
    --> use relative path
    --> handle case -> where file data doesn't exits -> create default file for them
    --> handle case -> folder does not exist -> create folder + file alongside

    --> able to read csv file and convert to list of gnosis.main.model.gnosis.task - Done
    --> able to write to csv file from list of gnosis.main.model.gnosis.task - Done

2. Update gnosis.main.model.gnosis.task classes: - DONE
    --> to include char variable to store type of gnosis.task
    --> getter and setters
    --> update classes

3. Print message of saving and loading to User
