Refactor the code to extract out closely related code as classes.

Minimal: Extract the following classes:
Ui: deals with interactions with the user
Storage: deals with loading tasks from the file and saving tasks in the file
Parser: deals with making sense of the user command
TaskList: contains the gnosis.task list e.g., it has operations to add/delete tasks in the list


what I need to achieve for increment:

gnosis.ui.GnosisUI:
-- all the UI related contexts
--  greet user
--- show error messages
--- get user input
--- respond to User

GnsosiController:
-- Handles logic between UI and gnosis.main.model flow

GnosisStorage:
-- aka fileManager for saving/loading

GnosisParser:
-- aka logic gnosis.controller for reciving user command

GnsosisTaskManager:
-- gnosis.main.model.gnosis.task Manager handling logic
