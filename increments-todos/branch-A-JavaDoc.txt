A-JavaDoc
â†³ Add JavaDoc comments

Add JavaDoc comments to the code.

Minimal: Add header comments to at least half of the non-private classes/methods.
Stretch goal: Add header comments to all non-private classes/methods, and non-trivial private methods.

Javadoc of class members can be specified on a single line as follows:

/** Number of connections to this database */
private int connectionCount;


A minimal JavaDoc comment example for classes:

package ...

import ...

/**
 * Represents a location in a 2D space. A <code>Point</code> object corresponds to
 * a coordinate represented by two integers e.g., <code>3,6</code>
 */
public class Point {
    // ...
}

A minimal JavaDoc comment example for methods:

/**
 * Returns lateral location of the specified position.
 * If the position is unset, NaN is returned.
 *
 * @param x X coordinate of position.
 * @param y Y coordinate of position.
 * @param zone Zone of position.
 * @return Lateral location.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If zone is <= 0.
 */
public double computeLocation(double x, double y, int zone)
    throws IllegalArgumentException {
    // ...
}

How should i start first:

1. Start with gnosis package
