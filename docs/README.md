## Features

> Notes about the command format:
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
    e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter that can be used as `todo buy groceries`.
> * Items in square brackets are optional.
    e.g `find [KEYWORD]...` can be used as `find crack` or `find`.
> * Items with â€¦ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
    e.g. `find [KEYWORD]...` can be used as `find` (i.e. 0 times), `find crack`, `find buy crack`.
> * Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as help, list and bye) will be ignored.
    e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
