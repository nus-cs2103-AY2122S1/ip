operates using **text commands**.

## 2. Quick Start

* Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
* Download the latest `duke.jar` [(here)](https://github.com/ruthpohrp/ip/releases).
* Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Dukewu.
* Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

  parameter which can be used as `todo TASK`.
* Commands are case-insensitive, e.g. `todo TASK` is computed the same way as `ToDo TASK`
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g. `TASK DATE [TIME]` can be used as `TASK DATE` or as `TASK 
  DATE TIME`.

## 5. FAQ
***
**Q:** `Dukewu.jar` isn't opening when I double click it.<br>
**A:** If you're on Windows, go to settings and change it so it runs Java(TM) Platform SE binary by 
default. If you're on Mac, make sure you have the latest version of Java installed before double-clicking 
on the .jar file. If all fails, you can manually open the .jar on the command terminal using the command 
`-java Dukewu.jar`. (Make sure your current directory is the directory where your .jar is before using the 
command.)  

**Q:** Will there be updates in the future?<br>
**A:** Sadly, I do not plan to have any big updates in the future. I'm trapped in homework hell.

**Q:** What is the secret to acing CS2103T?<br>
**A:** I would like to know that too :')
