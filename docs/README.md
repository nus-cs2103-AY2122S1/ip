## 1. Introduction
Dukewu is a modified version of the Personal Assistant Chatbot Duke, complete with owo language support. 
Dukewu can help you **manage your tasks** with an easy-to-read Graphical User Interface (GUI) that operates 
using text commands.

## 2. Quick Start
* Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
* Download the latest `duke.jar` [(here)](https://github.com/ruthpohrp/ip/releases).
* Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Dukewu.
* Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
