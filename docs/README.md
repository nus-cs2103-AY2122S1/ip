# Duke User Guide

Duke is a desktop app for task management, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, Duke can help you keep track of your work and study tasks handily!

## Features 

Note about the command format: 
- Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user. E.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is the parameter e.g. borrow a book.
- If a command line requires task `INDEX` as input, the index refers to the index number displayed after the `list` command. The index must be a positive integer within the range of indexes listed.

### Add a task

Adds a task to the address book. The task must be one of the three categories:
1. todo: A task not associated with a date or time.
2. deadline: A task that must be done before a deadline.
3. event: A task that takes place over a time window.

Format:
1. `todo DESCRIPTION`
2. `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE TIME`
3. `event DESCRIPTION /at DATE START_TIME END_TIME`

### List all tasks

List all tasks currently in the list.

Format: `list`

Tasks will be displayed in this format: `[type] [status] description (date time)`
- Type: T for todo, D for deadline, E for event
- Status: X for done. Blank for not done
- Date is in the format: Month Date Year
- Time is in 24-hour format

### Mark a task as done

Mark the specified task as done
 
Format: `done INDEX`

### Delete a task

Delete the specified task from the task list.
 
Format: `delete INDEX`

### Update a task

Update the specified task.

Format: `update INDEX CATEGORY CONTENT`

CATEGORY must be one of the following:
- `description`
- `date`
- `time`
- `start_time`
- `end_time`
The format of the `CONTENT` must match the `CATEGORY`. E.g., if `CATEGORY` is the date, the `CONTENT` must be a valid date like 2021-09-08.

### Find a task

Finds tasks whose description contains a string of keywords

Format: `find KEYWORDS`

Only the description is searched.<br/>
Only full words will be matched e.g. "project" will not match "projects".
