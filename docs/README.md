## Features 

### Add, update, track completion, and delete tasks.

You can add in three types of task to the list, and let DuC handle everything for you. 
What are the tasks in mention?
1. TODO: Task without deadline or timing, for you to do at your own pace
2. DEADLINE: Task with an upcoming end date (deadline) for you to complete before
3. EVENT: Self-explanatory - a task that occurs on a date for you to join

What can you do with DuC? You can:
- Add a task (there are 3 types of task to add!)
- Update a task description (you can even change the type of task you are updating!)
- Mark a task as completed (if it is done, mark it X rightaway!)
- Or delete a task at will (the list is too long? Delete it and save some spaces!)

&nbsp;

### View tasks and query tasks

View the list of all ongoing task on the list, and the date associated with them. Search for task that match a given query.

&nbsp;
