Duke is a text-based reminder chatbot that helps you keep track of your

## Features 

### Task management

There are 3 types of tasks.
1. Todos: General tasks that need to be done.
2. Deadlines: Tasks that need to be finished by the specified date.
3. Events: Tasks that will occur at the specified date and time.


#### What you can do with Tasks:
1. Create them
2. View them
3. Delete them
4. Search for them with keywords
5. Mark them as done

### Adding Notes

You can also take notes about anything under the sun. The date and time of when you created the note is saved, so you can take down whatever you like and Duke will remember!

Note commands are quite similar to Task commands.
