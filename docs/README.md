Undone!

3.[E][X] bread sale (at: when its dark outside)
```
If the previous command was done 3 ie. mark task 3 as done undo would change the list to:
```
1.[T][ ] eat bread
2.[D][ ] finish bread (by: 11 Sep 2021)
3.[E][ ] bread sale (at: when its dark outside)
```
Undo again would result in:

1.[T][ ] eat bread
2.[D][ ] finish bread (by: 11 Sep 2021)

If there are no previous commands which change the list, undo would result in no change.

```
Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
