### Marking a task as done: `done [index]`
Marks the task at the specified index as done. Index is the number in front of the task returned by the list command. 

Example of usage:

First, list all the tasks:

`list`

Expected Output:
```
1. [T][] read book
2. [T][] return book
3. [D][] assignment 1 (by: Sep 17 2021)

Then to mark the third task as done:

`done 3`

Expected Output:
```
Nice! I've marked this task as done:
[D][X] assignment 1 (by: Sep 17 2021)
```


### Searching for a task: `find [description]`
Finds tasks whose description, date or time contain any of the given keywords.
* The search is case-sensitive. For example, ```Assignment 1``` will not match ```assignment 1```
* The order of the keywords matters. For example, ```1 assignment``` will not match ```assignment 1```.
* Partial words can be matched. For example, ```assign``` will match ```assignment 1```.

Example of usage:

`find book`

Expected outcome:

Returns all tasks with 'book' in its description.

```
Here are the matching tasks in your list:
1. [T][] read book
2. [T][] return book
```


### Deleting a task: `delete [index]`

1. [T][] read book
2. [T][] return book
3. [D][] assignment 1 (by: Sep 17 2021)
