## Usage

### `todo {description}` - Add Tasks

A Todo task with the description you entered will be created. `event`, `deadline`, or `add`
can be used in place of `todo` to create different types of tasks.

Example of usage:

`todo CS2103T assignment`

`add CS2103T assignment`

`deadline CS2103T assignment /by 05/09/21`

`event CS2103T meeting /at 05/09/21 07:00`

Note that deadline and event type of tasks require you to add time argument after
`/at` or `/by`.

While Saber supports multiple time format, to be safe, please follow either of the above format.

Expected outcome:

Saber will reply you acknowledging the creation of a Todo / Normal Tasks.

(This reply may vary depending on what type of task you create)

```
      Yes, Master.
      I'll add the following to your Todo list:

      in the list.
