# InferiorDuke

Welcome, ***stalker***, to my *personal* rendition of ~~Duke~~ aka InferiorDuke, the task list bot more insecure than you!

Please be patient with him as he's kind of slow and stupid, and sometimes he doesn't perform things that he should but with enough patient, love and warmth, InferiorDuke will one day flourish into the beautiful flower he can be!
