### `save` - Saving data to local drive

For every new task that had been added or deleted from Duke, Duke will perform an auto-save to the *data.txt* file in the same directory as the *jar* file. Closing the app will not cause Duke to lose track of the tasks that had been previously added. Restarting the app should load previously added tasks and performing the command `list` should display these tasks.
