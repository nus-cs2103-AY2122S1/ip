### 3.1 Duplicate Clients
A client is considered to be the same as another client if they share the same **name** and **email**.

LeadsForce has checks that prevent users from creating duplicated contacts.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
 <p><img src="images/info_icon.png" width="30"/><b>Notes about having the same client information for various attributes:</b></p>

* Users have the flexibility to give the same name, email, phone number or any other attributes to multiple users, as long as
  2 separate clients do not end up with the same name and email.

</div>

### 3.2 Next Meeting Attribute
The `Next Meeting` attribute refers to the next meeting that the financial advisor using has with the client. Each `Next Meeting` consists of a *date*, *start time*, *end time* and a *location*.

`m/dd-MM-yyyy (hh:mm~hh:mm), {non-empty location string}`

where
* *date* is in the format `dd-MM-yyyy`, where day, month and year are numerical values
* *startTime* and *endTime* are in `hh:mm` (24 hour format)

| :---: | --- |
| <img src="images/info_icon.png" width="50"/> | • `Next Meeting` will automatically be updated to null when the current time passes the date and end time of the meeting and this happens whenever the application is booted up. At the same time, the `Last Met` attribute will be updated to take on the current date. |

| Example | `l/25-10-2021`|
:---: | ---
| <img src="images/info_icon.png" width="50"/> | • `Last Met` cannot take dates in the future, but any other past dates up to today's date is OK. |

For instance, the command `sort r/ASC` sorts users by their risk appetite in ascending order. <br> 
<p align="center" >
  <img src="images/ExpectedSortCommand.png" width="600"/>

| <img src="images/info_icon.png" width="50"/> | • Works similar to `search` but `filter` works based on the current list shown as opposed to entire lists of contacts. <br> • If no `KEYWORD` is provided, then filter will be based on `<attribute>/{ATTRIBUTE_KEYWORD}` <br> • The filter is case-insensitive. e.g `keith` will match `Keith`. <br> • The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `John Doe` will match `Doe John`. <br> • Clients matching at least one keyword will be returned). <br> e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`. <br> • If attribute keyword is provided, only clients whose attribute matches with the attribute keyword will be returned. <br> e.g. `Tom Tim e/@gmail.com` will return `Tom Lee e/Tom@gmail.com` and not `Tim Shum e/Tim@yahoo.com`.|
| <img src="images/tip_icon.png" width="50"/> | • Use the tags found under the command box to quickly filter clients by their tags. Simply click on a tag and press enter to filter clients with the specific tag. <br> eg. Pressing the `classmate` button allows you to filter clients with the `classmate` tag. <br> <img src=images/FilterTagCommand.png width="300">|

**Expected Outcome:** <br>
For instance, using `filter t/colleagues` will produce the following result.
