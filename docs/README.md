# User Guide
## The Seagull Tasker
Welcome to the User Guide for the Seagull Tasker! Follow this
guide to easily get your next handy Task Manager set up and
ready to start keeping track of your tasks!

The Seagull Tasker is a standalone application that can manage
your _todos_, _deadlines_ and _events_, **all from one app**! Using the
integrated task list, you can easily add and remove tasks,
mark a task as done, as well as searching through them easily!

<br>

## Installation
Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/TLChicken/ip/releases) page
for the Seagull Tasker, and download the latest executable version.
Place it in a folder that is convenient to access. The folder
that contains the save file for your tasks would be created
in this folder.

### To use the app:
1. First check that your computer has Java 11 or above.
1. Next, double-click the Seagull Tasker to start the app!
1. Test some commands! Send `help` to the Seagull Tasker to view the help screen.

## Features 

### Task Tracking

The Seagull Tasker can keep track of 3 types of tasks:
* Todos - Simple tasks!
* Deadlines - Set a deadline by including a date!
* Events - Include the location of your task!

Fully make use of it to organise your life!!!

### Search Feature
Use the `find` command to easily search through your tasklist
using keywords!

### Local XML Save Data
Your tasklist would be saved in your local storage as an XML file.
Hence data in the save file would be structured better than if a plaintext save file
was used, and it could also be read using an external XML file editor!

Easily transfer your data across devices by sending the save file over.
