# User Guide
![Ui](Ui.png)

Duke is a **to-do list application, which can be used to track to-dos, events and deadlines**. 
Duke is built to replicate a chat-bot, so that users feel more comfortable using Duke.

Currently, tasks are divided into 3 categories: to dos, events and deadlines.

To dos are basic tasks, while events have a date which represents when the event is, 
and deadlines have a date which represents when the task is due by.

:bulb: **Tip:** The task list lists tasks in this format:

`[Type][isDone] taskName`

If the type contains a date,

`[Type][isDone] taskName (by/at: date)`

If a task is done, the box will be `[x]`, else `[]`.

Types are T, D and E, where T is task, D is deadline, E is event.

### Adding a task: `todo`,`deadline` and `event` <a name="add"/>
Since there are three types of tasks, there are three different commands to add the three different types of tasks.

`todo` adds a to-do typed task to the task list:
```
todo CS2103 assignment

Got it, I've added this task to your task list:
[T][] CS2103 assignment
Now you have 1 task in your task list.
```

`deadline` adds a deadline typed task to the task list:
```
deadline CS2103 assignment /by 2021-11-21 06:00

Got it, I've added this task to your task list:
[D][] CS2103 assignment
Now you have 1 task in your task list.
```

`event` adds an event typed task to the task list:
```
event CS2103 finals /at 2021-11-21 06:00

Got it, I've added this task to your task list:
[D][] CS2103 finals
Now you have 1 task in your task list.
```

**Use the following syntax:**
```
todo (task name)
deadline (task name) /by (date)
