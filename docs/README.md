## Usage

### Adding tasks

To add a task, enter `task_type` followed by the arguments. Further details are specified below.

#### ToDo tasks

ToDo tasks are specified simply by its textual description and identified with `[E]`. Simply enter `todo {description}`, such as:

`todo CS2103 iP Final Submission`

#### DeadLine tasks

DeadLine tasks are specified by a textual description field as well as a deadline (i.e. `deadline {description} /by {deadline}`). They are indicated by a `[D]` identifier:

`deadline CS2103 iP Final Submission /by today midnight`

#### Event tasks

Event tasks are specified similarly to DeadLine tasks, except that the `/by` token is replaced by the `/by` option and that they are identified with `[E]` instead of `[D]`, as follows:

`event CS2103 iP Final Submission /at 22nd September 2021 2359HRS`

### Date format parsing 

If the deadline or time field of a DeadLine or Event task is entered in `yyyy-mm-dd` format, it is automatically recognised, parsed and converted into `MMM dd yyyy` format. Or else, the deadline field silently defaults to storing the string as-is without any modifications:

`deadline CS2103 iP Final Submission /by 2021-22-09`


### Viewing tasks

To view the list of tasks added to Dude, enter:

`list`

The tasks are displayed in a list according to the order they are added to Dude, and identified by their index in this list.

### Saving tasks

To save the current list of tasks, use the command:

`save`

This writes to a `dude_data.txt` file.

### The following commands recognise a task by its index on the task list

#### Marking tasks as done

The command `done {task number}` marks a task as done, causing the `[ ]` column to be replaced by `[x]`.

#### Deleting tasks

To delete a task, enter `delete {task number}`.  

### Searching for task by keyword

Entering the `find` command with any keyword will prompt Dude to search the task list for any tasks that contain matching keywords.

### Exiting Dude

Unfortunately, exiting Dude via a command is currently not supported. Please click on the exit button on Dude's window to exit instead.
