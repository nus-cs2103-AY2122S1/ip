## Features 

### Creating Tasks

In Augury, there are 3 different types of tasks you can create.

- Todos
- Events
- Deadlines

**Todos**

**Todos** are basic tasks that have a **description** and **completion status**.
They are represented with `[T]` in the app.

**Events**

**Events** are tasks that happen at a specific time.
Events contain a **description**, **completion status**, and the **time**.
They are represented with `[E]` in the app.

**Deadlines**

**Deadlines** are tasks that have to be completed by a specific time.
Deadlines contain a **description**, **completion status**, and the **time**.
They are represented with `[D]` in the app.
