## FAQ  
Q: What version of Java should I use?  
A: Please use Java 11 or a later version.

Q: How do I save my progress?  
A: Data is automatically saved in your computer :)

Q: What is the data/duke.txt file generated after running the app?  
A: It is the save file of the app. Please do not edit the folder and file in any way, 
as it can lead to file corruption.

Q: Why does my JAR file not run?  
A: It is likely that the save file has been corrupted. 
Check the duke.txt file saved in the data folder for any noticeable errors.
If all else fails, clear the file or delete the folder.   
Do note that doing so erases your progress.
