## 4. Make me better? 📈

Prerequisites: JDK 11, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
2. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
3. Configure the project to use **JDK 11** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialogue, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
4. After that, locate the `src/main/java/Launcher.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Launcher.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). 

```java
Launcher.java

public class Launcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application.launch(Main.class, args);
    }
}
```

If the setup is correct, you should see something like this: (Try entering the command `event meet Tim /at 2103-03-21T21:03:21`, you should be able to get a simialr output.)
