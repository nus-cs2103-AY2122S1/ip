## Client Information

Every client that is registered in LeadsForce have the following attributes that has the corresponding attribute type and argument tag.

Client Attribute | Type of Attribute | Argument Tag
-----------------|-----------------|-----------------
Client ID (**Unique**) | Integer (assigned on creation of new contact) | i/
Name (**Compulsory**) | String | n/
Email (**Compulsory**)| String (email address)| e/
Address | String | a/
Current financial plans | List of Strings | c/
Disposable Income | Integer | d/
Last met | Date | l/
Next Meeting | Composite (More information below table) | m/
Contact number | Integer (8 digits long)| p/
Risk appetite | Integer from 1-5, <br>where 1 is very low risk tolerance and 5 is very high risk tolerance| r/
Tag | String | t/

### NextMeeting
NextMeeting entails the next meeting's *date*, *startTime*, *endTime* and *location*.
A NextMeeting needs to be inputted in the following form:

`m/dd-MM-yyyy (hh:mm~hh:mm), {non-empty location string)`

where
* *date* is in the format `dd-MM-yyyy`
* *startTime* and *endTime* are in `hh:mm` (24 hour format)
* *location* is a non-empty string

For example, a valid NextMeeting is:

`m/25-12-2021 (00:00~23:59), Santa's Workshop`

Furthermore, when the NextMeeting is over, the NextMeeting will automatically be set to null.
This happens whenever the changes are made to the client list or when the address book is opened/loaded.

### LastMet
Similar to NextMeeting, the LastMet is automatically updated from a NextMeeting that is over.
